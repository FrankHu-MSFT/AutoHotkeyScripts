# AutoHotkeyScripts

This is a small AutoHotKey Script to get git author name, label github questions, and post templates for Git IR, MSDN Follow up, and git follow up, and some other things.

I've begun using this and figured to share it out to the team to see if anyone's interested in using it.

Autohotkey is a way to press a bunch of keys, when pressing one key. 
This script converts the number keypad into a set of macros. 

1. Get Github Author Name
